*This package installation will:*

** Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. See `/etc/init.d/jenkins` for more details.
** Create a `jenkins` user to run this service.
** Direct console log output to the file `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log.` Check this file if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
** Populate `/etc/default/jenkins` with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g `JENKINS_HOME`
** Set Jenkins to listen on port `8080`. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

TIP: If your `/etc/init.d/jenkins` file fails to start Jenkins, edit the `/etc/default/jenkins` to replace the line `----HTTP_PORT=8080----` with `----HTTP_PORT=8081----` Here, "8081" was chosen but you can put another port available.

* While configuring on UI select `Install recommended plugins`.
